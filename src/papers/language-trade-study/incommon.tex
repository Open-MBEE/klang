\label{sec:common}

An OCLInEcore class can contain: annotations, structural features attributes and references), operations and invariants, 
just like K can contain annotations, properties (combines OCLInEcore attributes and references), functions and
requirements.

The Constraints syntax supports the embedding of OCL expressions as invariants for classes, as preconditions, postconditions or bodies for operations and initial or derived values for properties.

In structural definitions, OCLInEcore supports:

\begin{itemize}
  \item *, + and ?
  \item lower bound
  \item lower and upper bound
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, attributes and references can be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item id, derived, composes (only for references), 
    readonly, ordered, unique
\end{itemize}
