\label{sec:kpros}

\begin{itemize}
  \item keyword syntax for class definitions.
  \item allows properties, functions and constraints to be declared at outermost level.
  \item side-effects: assignment statements, while loops, ...
  \item K has function types.
  \item K has predicate subtypes, although OCLInEcore also seems
    to have that through datatypes, which can be constrained
    with a predicate. In OCLInEcore they can only be declared 
    at the outermost level though.
  \item K has a programming language with side effects.
  \item Quantification over infinite sets.
  \item Set comprehension over infinite sets.
  \item Lambda expressions.
  \item Class instantiation: creating objects
  \item Pattern matching
\end{itemize}
