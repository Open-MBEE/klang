\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we address the topic of {\em change} in a
software/modeling development environment. Our focus has been to
develop a language with verification support that enables
modelers/developers to easily study the effect of their change and
avoid making changes that could potentially lead to unsatisfiability
and inconsistencies. We study various types of problems, and how
consistency checking and change as {\em refinement} can be applicable
for each of those scenarios. While the topic of {\em change} itself is
extremely broad, we believe that a language oriented approach as
presented in this paper provides concrete value and provides a good
foundation for developing stronger techniques.

Chris Delp and Bradley Clement for the opportunities and insights they
provided during the development of the \Klang{} language.
