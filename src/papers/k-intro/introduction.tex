\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Modeling is the activity of formulating an abstract desciption of a
system to be implemented (or possibly already implemented). Modeling
includes such activities as requirements capture in the initial phases
and design of higher-level architectual decisions in later
stages. Modeling has been studied by various communities, of which at 
least two can be identified: the model-based engineering
community and the formal methods community. The {\em model-based
  engineering} community has suggested graphical modeling languages
such as UML \cite{uml} and SysML \cite{sysml}, a variant of UML. 
Both have been designed by the OMG (Object Management Group)
technology standards consortium. SysML is meant for systems
development more broadly considered, including physical systems as
well as software systems, in contrast to UML, which is mainly meant
for software development. These graphical formalisms have received a
high degree of popularity in industry due to their two dimensional
format, also sometimes referred to populistically as {\em boxology}:
boxes and arrows. However, drawbacks of these formalisms include lack of
precise semantics, lack of analysis capabilities, mouse-heavy
operation of GUIs, requiring lots of visual real estate even for simple models,
as well as large volumes of technologies. Learning UML and SysML
is not just learning very large languages, it is also learning a large
set of additional tools needed to work with
models. We formulate the hypothesis that these drawbacks are in part 
due to the lack of a simple textual language, at a the size comparable to 
a programming language, underlying the graphical notations.

From an even earlier point in time in the 1960ties, the {\em formal
  methods} community, part of the computer science community, and
closely connected to the programming language community, has over the
years proposed numerous formally founded specification languages,
several of which are based on predicate logic and set theory. These
languages are, compared to UML and SysML, concise, small, well defined
in the form of semantics, and in recent time well supported with
analysis capabilities. The obvious observation is that it might be
fruitfull to study the interaction between the two classes of
formalisms. Consider furthermore that programming languages are
gaining in abstraction, such as for example combining object-oriented
and functional programming. An example is Scala (the language in which
K is implemented), which has many commonalities with very early formal
specification languages, such as for example VDM \cite{vdm78}, and
specifically its object-oriented variant VDM$^{++}$
\cite{vdmplusplus05}.  The study should therefore include the
ineraction between the graphical formalisms, the formal methods
modeling languages, and programming languages.

We report on an effort to formally ground SysML in a new textual
formal specification language, named K (Kernel language), designed
specifically for this purpose.  K supports object-oriented concepts
such as classes, multiple inheritance, and object instances. The
contents of classes can be typed values, including functions, and
constraints over these. K also contains programming constructs such as
variables, assignment statements, and looping constructs, and can as
such be seen as a wide-spectrum modeling and programming language.
The K language can be seen as vehicle for giving semantics to SysML,
providing analysis capabilities, and even provide an alternative to
modeling with the mouse: writing textual models in K directly, just
like one normally writes programs.  We in fact believe that modeling
can be seen as a programming in a language where some parts of the
model (program) at any point in time are executable, and some maybe 
are not (yet).

The idea of merging modeling and programming in one language has been
studied before, as will be discussed in the related work section. Our
contribution is the development of this technology as part of a larger
effort at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a SysML
model enginering toolset to be used by designers of the planned 2022
mission to Jupiter's Moon Europa, also referred to as the Europa
Clipper mission \cite{europa-clipper}. This tool set, named EMS (Engineering
Modeling System), supports graphical SysML modeling using MagicDraw
\cite{magicdraw} as well as textual K modeling using any editor of
convenience. Development of a textual language technology like K in a
context asking for it makes it a different experience than seen
in most earlier such efforts, whether or not the results will overlap.

The contents of the paper is as follows.  
Section \ref{sec:k-syntax} introduces a subset of the K language
through an example, which is similar to examples typically used
to illustrate such formal specification languages. Section \ref{sec:k2smt} outlines the translation
from K to the SMT-LIB input language for the purpose of analysis of
K models. This section is based on a different example illustrating how K
is actually currently used at JPL. Section \ref{sec:usage} explains the architecture of the
implementation and integration of K within the SysML development
framework, as well as the usage of this. Section \ref{sec:related-work}
discusses related work, and finally Section \ref{sec:conclusion}
concludes the paper. Appendix \ref{app:grammar} contains the grammar for K in ANTLR
\cite{antlr} format.
