The formal methods community has over the years proposed various 
formally founded specification languages based on predicate logic 
and set theory. At the same time the model-based engineering community 
has proposed less formally founded graphical formalisms such as UML and 
SysML. We report on an effort to formally ground SysML in a textual 
formal language, named K, supporting classes, multiple inheritance, predicate 
logic and set theory. K contains programming constructs, and can thus be 
considered as a  wide-spectrum modeling and programming language. We further 
explain the translation of a subset of this textual language to the input 
language of the SMT-LIB standard, and the application of Z3 for analysis 
of the generated SMT-LIB formulas. The entire effort is part of a larger 
effort to develop a general purpose SysML development framework for designing 
systems, currently supporting the design of NASA's planned 2022 mission to 
Jupiter's Moon Europa.
