I miss details about limitations of the language. Is it covering all
the constructs of the SysML language?

However, there is a practical use of the language which means that the
utility is proven. It would be nice to have more information about the
actual usage of the language and the perception of the users.

Review #: 3	    

Paper formatting needs adjustment?       Yes - reviewer 3

I still have a lot of questions related to K, but as the paper's goal
was not to present K in details, they are of little relevance.

For example: Why doesn't K support ordered unique collections (ordered
sets), as it supports only three out of four possible combinations of
uniqueness and ordering?

What is the difference between properties declared with var (Figure 1,
line 15) and those without?

It seems that the value returned from functions is implicit (the last
constructed value), but it is not clear how?

The syntax, wrt. the end of a statement is unclear â€“ looks to be
implicit (end of line)? Etc.
