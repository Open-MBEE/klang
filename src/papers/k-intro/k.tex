\section{Introduction to \Klang{}}
\label{sec:k-syntax}

In this section we introduce the \Klang{} language. We use the
\Klang{} model in Figure~\ref{fig:fs} as our running example for
discussing core concepts in \Klang{}. The example shows a basic model
of a file system modeled using \Klang{}. It is intended to be a
basis for discussing language features, and not a complete model of
the flash file system. Appendix~\ref{app:grammar} shows the ANTLR
grammar for \Klang{} (with trivial parts removed).

\Klang{} is a high level textual language which supports multiple
paradigms. It allows one to create \name{packages}, which are
collections of \name{classes}. Packages can be \name{imported} by
other \Klang{} files. Line 1 in Figure~\ref{fig:fs} shows an example
of a package declaration. Classes, similar to other languages provide
a means for abstracting and collecting properties (member instance
variables). In \Klang{}, classes may contain properties, functions, and
constraints (requirements). Lines 7 -- 10 in Figure~\ref{fig:fs}
declare an \code{Entry} class, which contains two members: property
\code{name} of type \code{String}, and function \code{size} that takes
no arguments and returns an \code{Int}. The function implementation is
not specified for function \code{size}. \code{String} is one of the
six primitive types provided by \Klang{}: \code{Int}, \code{Real},
\code{String}, \code{Char}, \code{Unit}, and \code{Boolean}. \Klang{}
also provides the following collections:

\begin{description}
\item [Bag:] collection of items not subject to any order
  or uniqueness constraints.
\item [Seq:] collection of items subject to an ordering, but
  no uniqueness constraints.
\item [Set:] collection of items subject to uniqueness, but no
  ordering constraints.
\end{description}

\noindent \Klang{} provides {\em predicate subtypes}. Line 5 specifies
a subtype named \code{Byte}, which is derived from the \code{Int} type
but restricted to values between 0 and 256. \Klang{} allows classes to
inherit from one or more classes. For example, class \code{Dir},
specified on lines 12 -- 17 extends the \code{Entry} class. As with
other languages, inheritance causes the child classes to inherit the
instance variables and functions of the parent classes, but in
addition, in \Klang{}, the child classes also inherit the constraints
from the parent classes. In the case of multiple inheritance, \Klang{}
requires that the property names be unique across all
classes. Functions on the other hand may be overloaded by changing the
function signature. Both class \code{File} and \code{Dir} inherit from
class \code{Entry}. Lines 14 -- 16 in Figure~\ref{fig:fs} show the
implementation for the \code{size} function in the \code{Dir}
class. It makes use of the \code{sum} function, that is provided by
\Klang{} for all collections. The \code{size} function is the same as
declared in class \code{Entry}. Currently, function bodies cannot be
declared more than once along an inheritance path. Functions may take
an arbitrary number of arguments and return a single value. \Klang{}
also provides tuples to group objects together. On line 27, we
see a constraint being specified for class \code{Block} using the
\code{req} keyword. The constraint specifies that the size function of
\code{Block} should always return a value that is less than or equal
to the value specified in the global property \code{SIZE\_OF\_BLOCK}
(left unspecified). Any number of constraints can be specified at the
global scope or within classes.

Class \code{FileSystem} contains two functions: \code{mkDir} and
\code{rmDir}. The \code{mkDir} function takes a single argument
(\code{n} of type \code{String}) and returns a \code{FileSystem}
object which contains one additional directory entry that has name
\code{n}. The \code{rmDir} function has no body specified. Both
functions are defined along with a {\em function
  specification}. Function specifications are a list of {\em pre} and
{\em post} conditions that describe the precondition and postcondition
of the function. Any number of specifications may be provided. Line 34
specifies the precondition for function \code{mkDir} with the use of
an {\em existential} quantifier. It specifies that when creating a
directory in the file system, the given name \code{n} should not exist
in the current set of entries in the file system. \Klang{} provides
both {\em existential} and {\em universal} quantification in it's
expression language. For the same function, line 35 specifies the
postcondition. \code{\$result} is a reserved word that refers to the
return value of the function. It can only be used when specifying
postconditions. The post condition for \code{mkDir} specifies that
function \code{mkDir} returns a \code{FileSystem} object that has the
same size as the current \code{FileSystem} object, which was used to
create the new directory. Line 36, which is the body of function
\code{mkDir} creates a new \code{FileSystem} object by calling the
constructor for class \code{FileSystem}. The only argument provided to
the constructor is a \code{Dir} object which contains one additional
\code{Dir} entry whose name is \code{n}. \Klang{} provides
constructors automatically for all classes where the arguments are
{\em named arguments}. Each named argument is of the form \code{member
  :: value} where the \code{::} notation is used as a form of
assignment. Multiple named arguments can be provided as a comma
delimited list. It is not necessary to specify a value for all members
of a class. Any members that are specified in a constructor call are
assigned the specified value, and the rest are left under
specified. Line 39 invokes the \code{FileSystem} constructor as well
as the \code{Dir} constructor to create a new \code{FileSystem} object
that contains an additional directory. Function \code{rmDir} is
specified with no body, but only function specifications. The function
specifications require that function \code{rmDir} only execute if the
provided directory \code{n} exists in the current object's
contents. The postcondition specifies that the resulting
\code{FileSystem} object should be either the same size or smaller
relative to the current object.

Expressions in \Klang{} are the core of the language. Logical
expressions in \Klang{} allow one to write assignments, binary
expressions (such as and, or, implication, iff etc.), logical negation,
arithmetic negation, quantification, \code{is} for checking type, and
\code{as} for type casting. Any expression can use variables, function
application, lambda functions, and dot expressions. \Klang{} also
supports control expressions such as \code{if-then-else},
\code{while}, \code{match}, \code{for}, \code{continue}, \code{break},
and \code{return}. These expressions are similar to control
expressions provided in other languages such as Scala or Java. A
detailed description of the expression language is beyond the scope of
this paper. Appendix~\ref{app:grammar} provides the complete grammar
for the expression language.

\Klang{} also provides {\em multiplicities} as part of the
language. The concept is highly influenced by multiplicities that can
be found in graphical formalisms such as UML/SysML. The goal with
multiplicities is to be able to specify the size of a collection. For
example, Figure~\ref{fig:mult} shows a \Klang{} model of a
\code{Person} that has various member properties, and the
corresponding inferred type for each member property. We will analyze
each of these individually.

\end{subfigure}
\\
\end{tabular}
\label{fig:mult}
\end{figure}

Each \code{Person} can have exactly one \code{mother}. This is
specified by line 4. No explicit multiplicity is specified, which is
assumed to be a multiplicity of 1. A \code{Person} can also have
\code{children}, which is specified by line 5. Line 6 specifies that a
\code{Person} has \code{cars}, which semantically translates to a
\code{Bag} (\Klang{} default) of \code{Car}, but is written using a
multiplicity (as opposed to the use of a collection). Finally, a
person may own many \code{prtflios}, which is a \code{Set} of
\code{Stock}, specified to have a multiplicity of 1 or
more. This translates to \code{prtflios} being a \code{Bag} of
\code{Set[Stock]} with at least 1 entry and no upper limit.

\sysml{} models also carry a lot of meta data information in them. To
accommodate for this, \Klang{} also provides the {\em annotation}
construct. New annotations can be created and applied to classes,
expressions, functions etc. Currently, each annotation has a name and
a type.

\subsection{K Type Checking}

The \Klang{} type checker performs basic checks on the provided input
to ensure naming and type consistency. It is used to ensure that all
declarations, expressions, annotations etc. are logically sound and
reference names (functions, members, variables) that exist and are
type consistent in the given context. Type information for all
expressions and any other inferences made by the type checker are
saved and made available to all other analyses/modules in the \Klang{}
tool chain. Further, the type checker imposes a stricter set of rules
on the provided input to ensure that it can be completely and
correctly translated to SMT. More details are provided in
Section~\ref{sec:k2smt}. The type checker is implemented as a stand
alone module, which is invoked after the AST has been constructed by a
visitor (interfacing with ANTLR). The implementation is done using
Scala.
