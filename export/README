To create a new K drop, ensure that you have the latest k.jar file exported from the sources. This should be placed in the lib folder. 

Invoke createKDrop script and provide an operating system (windows or osx) followed by the path to a directory where you want the drop created. 

A new directory "k-OSNAME-DATE" will be created where OSNAME is the name of the target operating system and DATE is today's date. 

This directory will contain everything to execute K on the target OS.
