To create a new K drop, ensure that you have the latest k.jar file exported from the sources. This should be placed in the lib folder. 

Invoke createKDrop script and provide an operating system (windows or osx) followed by the path to a directory where you want the drop created. 

A new directory "k-OSNAME-DATE" will be created where OSNAME is the name of the target operating system and DATE is today's date. 

This directory will contain everything to execute K on the target OS. 

Use 'all' script to create drops for all operarting systems in current folder

Note: you need bash installed on Windows if you need to use this infrastructure on a windows machine. Nothing special needed for OSX
