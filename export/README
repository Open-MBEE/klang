To create a K drop:

0. You need bash installed on Windows if you need to use this 
   infrastructure on a windows machine. Nothing special needed for OSX.

1. create a new k.jar file from the sources:
   1.1 In Eclipse run the Java program CreateJar in k.frontend (Run as Java Application).
   1.2 File->export->Java->Runnable JAR file.
   1.3 Run it (gives a warning, not a problem).
   1.4 Move the jar file to the export/lib folder of the K distribution.

2. In export directory run:

     ./createKDrop osx /path/To/Dir

   or:

     ./createKDrop windows /path/To/Dir

   to store a drop in /path/To/Dir.

   or:

     ./all

   to store windows and osx drop in the export folder.

   New directories "k-OSNAME-DATE" will be created where OSNAME is the 
   name of the target operating system and DATE is today's date.
   These directories will contain everything to execute K on the target OS.

3. zip up and ship these folders with https://lft.jpl.nasa.gov.
